# Metric Machine
## Assignment 3

---

Starting from the [tutorial](https://editor.p5js.org/luisa/sketches/WgwGy9AKX) to make a drum machine I wanted to see what would happen if the samples were already a drum pattern. And to spice things up, what happens when the samples have different metrics. So I made 6 samples of an acoustic drum playing the simplest pattern I could think of with metrics from 2/4 to 7/8. 
This was inspired on those songs that change their metric during the song which always caughts my attention and wonder how awesome the musicians must be to be able to compute this in their brains and keep shifting their inner metronome. 
Like [Tom Sawyer](https://youtu.be/auLBLk4ibAk?t=93) by Rush.

I also added a slider for the bpm which made things more complicated. When making the samples I didn't consider that they had different durations, therefore they can get all mixed up or have silences in between. This could be an extra feature, but it looses the purpose of making songs that shift metrics in between.
