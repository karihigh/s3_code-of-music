    Use of the bass drum, snare, hi-hat and crash. No toms or other cymbals.
    Many ghost eighth notes and fills on the snare and hi-hat.
    The pattern builds a melody that is more noticeable than a simple accompaniment of the song.
- Electric **guitar**, distorted riff
    Starts simple but in the interludes it divides into a very marked stereo. 
    In the second verse it disappears and comes back again in the second interlude.
- Analogue synth deep **bass**
    Simple and continuos melody, three chords per bar.
- Female **voice**, airy, reverbed
- Female **choirs**, almost spooky
- Down tuned whispered words
- Notorious auto-tuned voice that correlates with a processed voice
- **Violins**, multiple voices, a higher voice and a bass doubling

### Interactive Experience

**Title:** Song Cake

**Description**  

An easy way to understand the musicality of a song is to dissect its parts. These could be either by the parts that happen horizontally through a timeline. What happens in the introduction, the verse, the chorus and the end. Another way is by looking at it in the vertical axis. This is by paying attention to every sound that happens at the same time.

For this particular song, the vertical way of looking at it makes more sense to value its rich complexity. Similar to a layered cake, each sound that generally corresponds to an instrument is position on top of each other building a complete portion of delicious sound.

The frosting that sticks it together can be seen as the mixing of the sounds so that they aren't just thrown randomly at the same time and competing with each other. But rather harmoniously bonded. The same ingredient also covers the final result of the layers. It seals the outter part of the cake conforming it into a song. 

In a three-dimensional visualization of a layer cake, this experience will assign one layer to each distinguishable sound of the song. This cake will rotate around like a record but instead of looking from the top, you will be able to explore through it. The layers could organized by hierarchy, from the most recognizable melody to the almost invisible arrangements. Or by pitch, from the bass that supports the structure to the ethereal voice choirs on the top. Once inside the cake, one can step through each layer to listen to it louder and get a 'closer look' as the song plays.
